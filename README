# About
Logisim component library for the computer architecture class at the Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen (DIKU).
The library contains components (ALU, register bank, program ROM, RAM, PLA) to facilitate the development of a MIPS microarchitecture.

The MIPS components are originally provided by Kevin Walsh, Cornell University.

The PLA component is originally from KredsDesign by Rasmus Fonseca.
